&ndash; The zlib License, which is listed in [simd/jsimdext.inc](simd/jsimdext.inc)

  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg&ndash;turbo
  SIMD extensions.


Complying with the libjpeg&ndash;turbo Licenses
=========================================

This section provides a roll&ndash;up of the libjpeg&ndash;turbo licensing terms, to the
best of our understanding.

1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg&ndash;turbo source,
    then:

    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
        from the source.

        **Origin**
        &ndash; Clause 1 of the IJG License
        &ndash; Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
        &ndash; Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
        there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
        simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

        **Origin**
        &ndash; Clause 1 of the IJG License
        &ndash; Clause 2 of the zlib License

    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
        copyright or license text in that file.

        **Origin**
        &ndash; Clause 1 of the IJG License

2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg&ndash;turbo binaries without the source, or
    if you are distributing an application that statically links with
    libjpeg&ndash;turbo, then:

    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

        This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
        Group.

        **Origin**
        &ndash; Clause 2 of the IJG license

    2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
        your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
        License.

        **Origin**
        &ndash; Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg&ndash;turbo Project or the
    contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

    **Origin**
    &ndash; IJG License
    &ndash; Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

4.  The IJG and The libjpeg&ndash;turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg&ndash;turbo to be
    free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
    consequences resulting from your use of the software.

    **Origin**
    &ndash; IJG License
    &ndash; Modified BSD License
    &ndash; zlib License
